    <div class="one-half column">As a kid growing up in the city of Detroit, I was enamoured by the Tigers.  
    	I would try to sneak in, or pay my way into any game I could, and when I couldn't, I would watch at the barber shop up the road that was owned by a family friend. 
    	One day, as he swept the hair out his front door and into the street, I noticed something.  A bird was picking up some of the hair and using it as nesting material for its eggs.
    	</div>
    <div class="one-half column">This incedent had a profound effect on me.  The idea that birds were having to resort to using human waste to survive was an idea that made me feel disgusted.  We had a hair problem, and no one wanted to talk about it.  I knew it was time to step up and speak my truth. The HHTBP isn't just about selling a superior product, it's also about getting serious when it comes to taking care of the planet.</div>

<!-- Note: columns can be nested, but it's not recommended since Skeleton's grid has %-based gutters, meaning a nested grid results in variable with gutters (which can end up being *really* small on certain browser/device sizes) -->
